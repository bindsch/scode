# scode sandbox configuration
# Copy to ~/.config/scode/sandbox.yaml
#
# Entries here are merged with built-in defaults:
#   - "blocked" adds to the default blocked list
#   - "allowed" overrides blocks recursively (path + descendants),
#     including defaults and your additions
#   - scalar options (net, fs_mode, strict, scrub_env) set defaults
#
# Priority: CLI flags > user config > project config > environment variables > built-in defaults
#
# Built-in defaults already block:
#   ~/Documents, ~/Desktop, ~/Pictures, ~/Downloads
#   ~/.aws, ~/.azure, ~/.config/gcloud, ~/.kube, ~/.docker
#   ~/.gnupg, ~/.1password, ~/.op, ~/.password-store
#   ~/.npmrc, ~/.netrc, ~/.git-credentials, ~/.pypirc
#   ~/.gem/credentials, ~/.cargo/credentials.toml
#   ~/.config/gh, ~/.config/hub
#   ~/Library (macOS, with browser/keychain carve-outs)
#   + additional Linux-specific blocks (browser profiles, keyrings, etc.)
#
# See also:
#   sandbox-strict.yaml - for use with --strict flag
#   sandbox-paranoid.yaml - maximum lockdown for untrusted code
#   sandbox-permissive.yaml - opens up dirs for trusted projects
#   sandbox-cloud-eng.yaml - for cloud/infra engineers

# Sandbox flags (uncomment to enable)
# These act as defaults; CLI flags always win.
# net: off             # disable network (same as --no-net)
# fs_mode: ro          # read-only project dir (same as --ro)
# strict: true         # deny-default sandbox (same as --strict)
# scrub_env: true      # strip API keys from env (same as --scrub-env)

# Block additional directories beyond defaults
# Note: inline comments (space + #) are stripped from unquoted values.
# Paths containing literal " #" should be quoted: - "~/path with # in name"
blocked:
  # - ~/Dropbox
  # - ~/OneDrive
  # - ~/.ssh

# Allow specific directories, overriding defaults
allowed:
  # - ~/Documents/projects
  # - ~/Downloads/datasets
