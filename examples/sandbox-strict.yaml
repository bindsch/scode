# Enables strict mode by default. No need to pass --strict on the command line.
# Note: strict mode already denies everything except project/system/explicit allows.
# "blocked" entries here mainly matter when you also allow a parent path.

strict: true

# Additional directories to explicitly block
blocked:
  - ~/.ssh
  - ~/Dropbox
  - ~/OneDrive

# In strict mode, only the project dir and system paths are allowed.
# Use "allowed" to grant access to specific extra directories.
